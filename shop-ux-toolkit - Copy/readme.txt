Improves WooCommerce UX and accessibility: clearer links, clickable hover lift, centered image titles, and keyboard-only focus.

== Description ==
The **Shop UX Toolkit** plugin enhances WooCommerce shop and product pages by addressing design and accessibility issues. Designed for the Storefront theme, it uses CSS to modify only WooCommerce code, leaving your theme untouched. It’s lightweight, with toggleable features, and may work with other themes showing similar issues (e.g., links without underlines), though testing is recommended.
= Improves Link Appearance =
* **What it does**: Adds underlines to WooCommerce page links (missing in Storefront) and removes them on hover.
* **Why it’s helpful**: Enhances readability, fixes Google PageSpeed Insights errors for links relying only on color, improving accessibility and potentially SEO.
= Adds Hover Effects to Category and Product Boxes =
* **What it does**: Applies a subtle lift and shadow effect only when hovering over clickable elements in category/product boxes, with fixed lower-left and lower-right corner coverage.
* **Why it’s helpful**: Signals clickability, creating a polished look that encourages clicks, potentially increasing click-through rates (CTR) and sales.
= Centers Titles in the Large Product Image Modal =
* **What it does**: Centers image titles in the enlarged image modal triggered by the magnifying glass on single-product images.
* **Why it’s helpful**: Improves readability and presentation in the gallery lightbox.
= Customizes Focus Outlines =
* **What it does**: Toggles focus outlines (visible borders around clickable elements) to appear only for keyboard navigation, not mouse/touch.
* **Why it’s helpful**: Ensures accessibility for keyboard users (including those with disabilities) while maintaining a clean look for mouse/touch users.
= Why Choose This Plugin? =
* **Enhanced User Experience**: Clear links and hover effects improve navigation and engagement.
* **Accessibility Compliance**: Meets standards for users with visual impairments or assistive technologies.
* **SEO Benefits**: Fixes PageSpeed Insights errors, potentially boosting search rankings.
* **Polished Design**: Delivers a consistent, professional look to build customer trust.
* **Flexible**: Toggle features on/off for minimal site speed impact.
